## Instructions

The goal of the game is to match all cards without losing stars. For every 20 moves made, one star will be removed. A match counts as one move, and a miss counts as 2. While the game is timed, here is no time limit.

## Requirements

The only requirement is a working internet connection, and a device with which to play the game. Simply open the HTML file in your browser and play!
